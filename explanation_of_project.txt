Project Overview
This project is a Biometric Attendance System that utilizes face recognition technology to automate and secure the attendance process.
 Unlike traditional methods such as manual entry or RFID cards, this system uses computer vision to identify individuals based 
 on their facial features, making attendance marking contactless, efficient, and less susceptible to proxy attendance.

How the System Works

1. User Registration:
   - New users are registered by entering their name and ID in the web interface.
   - When the user submits the form, the webcam opens, captures a set number of face images, and immediately closes.
   - The system displays a message on the screen confirming that the new user has been added and the model has been trained.

2. Model Training:
   - The system uses the collected face images to train a machine learning model (K-Nearest Neighbors, KNN) to recognize
    each registered user.
   - The trained model is saved for future predictions.

3. Attendance Marking:
   - When the "Take Attendance" button is clicked, the webcam opens, captures a single image, and immediately closes.
   - The face in the image is detected and compared against the trained model.
   - If a match is found, the user’s attendance is recorded in a CSV file with their name, ID, and timestamp.
   - The system displays a message on the screen confirming that attendance has been marked.

4. Web Interface:
   - The entire workflow is managed through a user-friendly web interface built with Flask.
   - Users can register, train the model, and mark attendance directly from their browser on the local network.

Tools and Libraries Used

- Python: Core programming language for the project.
- Flask: Web framework for building the user interface and handling HTTP requests.
- OpenCV (opencv-python): For image capture, face detection, and image processing.
- scikit-learn: For training and using the KNN face recognition model.
- NumPy: For numerical operations and image data manipulation.
- Pandas: For managing attendance records in CSV format.
- Joblib: For saving and loading the trained machine learning model.

Importance of Each Library

- OpenCV: Essential for all image-related operations—capturing webcam frames, detecting faces, and preprocessing images
 for the model.
- scikit-learn: Provides robust and easy-to-use machine learning algorithms. KNN is chosen for its simplicity and
 effectiveness in small to medium datasets.
- Flask: Enables the creation of a web-based interface, making the system accessible and easy to use for non-technical 
users.
- NumPy: Underpins all numerical operations, especially when flattening and reshaping image data for model training and 
prediction.
- Pandas: Simplifies the management of attendance logs, allowing for easy export, analysis, and reporting.
- Joblib: Allows for quick serialization and deserialization of the trained model, making the system efficient and persistent
 across sessions.

Summary

This project demonstrates how modern computer vision and machine learning tools can be combined to solve real-world
 problems like attendance management. The use of Python and its libraries makes the system modular, extensible, and 
 easy to maintain. The improved workflow ensures the webcam is only opened when needed and closes immediately after,
  providing a smooth and user-friendly experience. Future enhancements may include expanding the system's capabilities,
   such as integrating with other software solutions, adding more biometric features for verification, or improving the
    machine learning model's accuracy and speed.
